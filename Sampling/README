There are 3 methods to generate the result starting with the most general.

1.  The evaluation results for a certain sampling percentage can be simply reproduced by running evaluation_table_generator.py.
    There are a few adjustable variables as following:
        - datasets_path -> list containing the name of the json files that contains the path to the knowledge graph and
                            the learning problem.
        - samplers -> list of the abbreviation of the samplers as strings.
        - sampling_percentage -> the sampling percentage
        - x -> number of iterations for each sampler ( default value 50 )

    Note: Keep in mind that this file needs a considerable time to execute ( in hours).
          The edge samplers are not included in this file because they sample depending on edges. You can use the other
          evaluation methods described below to reproduce the evaluation results for random edge samplers.

2.  To perform the evaluation only for a single sampler in multiple samples, run sampling_multiple_run_performance_display.py.
    There are a few adjustable variables as following:
        - name of the json file (enter directly in line 30)
        - sampler -> the sampler object
        - x -> number of nodes to sample

3.  To evaluate a single sampler only in a single sample, run sampling_single_run_performance_display.py.
    There are a few adjustable variables as following:
        - name of the json file (enter directly in line 29)
        - sampler -> the sampler object
